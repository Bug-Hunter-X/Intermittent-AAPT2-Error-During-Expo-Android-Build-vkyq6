Several strategies can be tried to resolve this issue:

1. **Clean and Rebuild:** Thoroughly clean the project's build cache.  In some cases, cached files can lead to unexpected errors.
    ```bash
    expo prebuild --clean
    expo run:android
    ```

2. **Check for Conflicting Dependencies:** Examine the project's `package.json` for any conflicting or outdated dependencies. Update packages to their latest versions using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.

3. **Simplify the Project:** If possible, create a minimal reproducible example. Try stripping away unnecessary components or libraries to isolate the root cause of the error.

4. **Check Android SDK and Build Tools:** Ensure that the Android SDK and build tools are properly installed and configured. Run `expo doctor` to check the Expo setup.  Update components as needed.

5. **Invalidate Caches/Restart:** Invalidate caches within Android Studio (if used) and restart the IDE. Sometimes, a simple restart resolves odd build errors.

6. **Examine the Full Log:** While Expo's logs are often terse, try inspecting the full Android build log more carefully. Look for any hidden clues or warnings that could be indicative of the problem.

7. **Community Support:** Engage with the Expo community forums or GitHub issues.  Sharing the complete error logs might help others identify the issue.
