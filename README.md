# Expo Android Build - AAPT2 Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when building an Android APK using Expo CLI. The build process intermittently fails with an AAPT2 error, and the logs provided by Expo are insufficient for debugging.

The `buildError.js` file shows a simplified project structure where the error might manifest. The `buildSolution.js` contains potential solutions and workarounds.

This issue is particularly challenging due to its sporadic nature and the lack of specific error messages.  The aim of this repository is to aid in identifying and resolving this kind of obscure Android build problem with Expo.
